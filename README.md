# Football Club Puzzle
### What does this do?
A simple program that takes in a list of football teams and sorts the team into how many consonants the team's starts with and outputs the answers.
### Backstory
I was asked the question "What football team's name starts with 5 consonants?" I followed it up with "Do the names prior the word such as A.F.C Bournemouth work?" Soon realising it began with an A. The answer was Crystal Palace but to that I wandered if there were other lesser known teams which followed the rule therefore this program was born.
