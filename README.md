# Football Club Puzzle
### What does this do?
A simple program that takes in a list of football teams and sorts the team into how many consonants the team's starts with and outputs the answers.
### Backstory
I was asked the question "What football team's name starts with 5 consonants?" I followed it up with "Do the names prior the word such as A.F.C Bournemouth work?" Soon realising it began with an A. The answer was Crystal Palace but to that I wandered if there were other lesser known teams which followed the rule therefore this program was born.

### Resources
The teams.txt is a list of all football teams in England taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_football_clubs_in_England) when this was last loaded, I am using all clubs in the list including ones which are level 10. They are written in an easy format separated by line breaks.
